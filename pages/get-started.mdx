# Get Started

## How to install

You can install `SummerJS` so easy if you use `npm`:
```js
npm i summerjs
```
or, if you use `yarn`
```js
yarn add summerjs
```

## How to use

SummerJS supports javascript and typescript both. I suggest you use ts, because it supports type checking.

## Use it with javascript
if you use javascript, create file like `index.js` in your project, then type content like this:

```js
const {App} = require("summerjs");

App.any("/", async (ctx) => "hello world");

App.run();
```
then, run command in your terminal `node index.js`

then, you will get some info like this `server is running at 5000`

that ok, open your browser, visit [http://localhost:5000], you will see `hello world`

## Use it with typescript
if you use typescript, create file like `index.ts` in your project, then type content like this:
```js
import {App, Context} from "summerjs";

App.any("/", async (ctx: Context) => "hello world");

App.run();
```
then, run command in your terminal `ts-node index.ts`,

then, you will get some info like this `server is running at 5000`

that ok, open your browser, visit [http://localhost:5000], you will see `hello world`

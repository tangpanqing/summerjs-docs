# Route

It's so easy that route request url to some program. As you see, we can use some code like this:

```js
App.any("/", async (ctx: Context) => "hello world");
```

in `any` method, the first param is request url and second param is your program function.

the function name `any` means it can match all request method

## How to match different request method

As you know, the request method of `Restful` style api can be `POST`,`GET`,`PUT`,`DELETE`,

you can use some code like this to match it

```js
App.post("/", async (ctx: Context) => "this request's method is post");

App.get("/", async (ctx: Context) => "this request's method is get");

App.put("/", async (ctx: Context) => "this request's method is put");

App.delete("/", async (ctx: Context) => "this request's method is delete");
```

## How to match dynamic request url

In some case, we want same function to match dynamic request url, for example:

we want match request url `/city/paris` and `/city/london`, you can do it like this:

```js
App.any("/city/{city_name}", async (ctx: Context) => {
  let city_name = ctx.getString("city_name");

  return "the city name is " + city_name;
});
```

As you see, we can get param form url by `ctx.getString` function

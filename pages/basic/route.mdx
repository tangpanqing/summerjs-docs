# Route

It's so easy that route request url to some program. As you see, we can use some code like this:

```js
App.any("/", async (ctx: Context) => "hello world");
```

in `any` method, the first param is request url and second param is your program function.

the function name `any` means it can match all request method

## How to match different request method

As you know, the request method of restful style api can be `POST`,`GET`,`PUT`,`DELETE`,

you can use some code like this to match it

```js
App.post("/", async (ctx: Context) => "this request's method is post");

App.get("/", async (ctx: Context) => "this request's method is get");

App.put("/", async (ctx: Context) => "this request's method is put");

App.delete("/", async (ctx: Context) => "this request's method is delete");
```

# Database

It's so easy that get or create database record. Different with some other framework, I strongly suggest

## Add Record

As you know, the request method of `Restful` style api can be `POST`,`GET`,`PUT`,`DELETE`,

you can use some code like this to match it

```js
let city = new City();
city.city_name = "london";
city.city_type = 1;
let id = await ctx.table("city").insert(city);
```
